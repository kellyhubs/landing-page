# landing-page
A landing page for a website by using HTML and CSS. 

Built on top of an idea within <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, I made a silly fan page about my dogs. I followed the template that was provided but added by own pictures and text! 


## Screenshots of the Landing Page

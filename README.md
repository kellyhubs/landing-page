# landing-page
A landing page for a website by using HTML and CSS. 

Built on top of an idea within <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, I made a silly fan page about my dogs. The template was provided, however, I felt it would be boring following a template so I decided to put my own ideas to make it more fun.
